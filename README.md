# Number-guesser
A simple and fun number-guessing game built in Python! The program generates a random number within a set range and allows the user to interact with the game through basic input handling. This project demonstrates how to work with user input, validate data, and generate random numbers

Features:

-Prompts the user to choose the upper limit for the game
-Validates that the input is a digit before continuing
-Randomly generates a mystery number
-Clean, easy-to-read logic — perfect for beginners

How It Works:

-The program asks the user to type a number, which becomes the upper limit for the guessing range.
-It checks whether the input is a valid digit.
-A random number is generated using Python’s random module.
-The user can attempt to guess the number.
